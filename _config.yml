  I am a PhD candidate at KAIST [NSS Lab](https://nss.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}, advised by Professor [Seungwon Shin](https://nss.kaist.ac.kr/?page_id=29){:target="_blank"}. I received my master\'s and bachelor\'s degree in electrical engineering from KAIST. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning in cybersafety and scrutinizing its effects on cybersecurity. Privacy of individual clients in AI has been one of my focuses in research, and I am expanding my reach to understand the more imminent threats on the individual posed by the Web (e.g., malicious bots).
  
  Having grown up in both South Korea and the US, I had the opportunity to experience both cultures as a student, resulting in bilingual proficiency and a playlist curation that ranges from Bruno Mars to BTS. In terms of programming languages I\'m more versatile; my main programming languages (used in research) are Python, C, and Matlab and have adequate experience (e.g., projects, coursework) with Java, Scala, SQL, and Javascript. If you are interested in working together, feel free to drop an email at any time!

            Worked as an intern in the research team. Was assigned a project on using deep learning for anomaly detection of faulty factory components, where I developed a hierarchical classification system that helped decrease false negative samples.

          Under Professor Seungwon Shin, I was able to utilize my AI knowledge and apply it to CTI (cyber threat information) research. My Master's thesis is research on a knowledge-powered cross-domain investigation of cyber-extortion operators. This work presents an analysis of Clop, a ransomware campaign, using a devised investigation framework that utilizes information from multiple domains.

          During my time at KAIST I dedicated much of my time in exploring what I wanted to do in life. After a broad selection of courses from various fields, several undergraduate research programs, and extracurricular activities, I found that learning and discovering new knowledge was what I enjoyed and decided to continue this in graduate school.
